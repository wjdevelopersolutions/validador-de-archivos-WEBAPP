The FileReader object lets web applications asynchronously read the contents of files (or raw data buffers) stored on the user's computer, using File or Blob objects to specify the file or data to read.

File objects may be obtained from a FileList object returned as a result of a user selecting files using the <input> element, from a drag and drop operation's DataTransfer object, or from the mozGetAsFile() API on an HTMLCanvasElement.

Important note: FileReader is used to read file content from the user's (remote) system in secure ways only. It cannot be used to read a file by pathname from a file system. To read files by pathname in JavaScript, standard Ajax solutions should be used to do server-side file reading, with CORS permission if reading cross-domain.
